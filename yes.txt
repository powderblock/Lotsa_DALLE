I was a young pilot, flying high in the sky
Ready to serve my country, willing to die
I joined the ranks of Japan's finest
To defend our land, we'd never be silenced

In World War 2, I flew with pride
My wings took me where others would hide
I was a warrior, fearless and strong
My heart beat for Japan, all day long

I climbed into my Zero, ready to fight
My skills were sharp, my aim was right
I soared through the clouds, seeking my foes
Determined to win, I never froze

In World War 2, I flew with pride
My wings took me where others would hide
I was a warrior, fearless and strong
My heart beat for Japan, all day long

The battles were fierce, the skies were ablaze
My brothers beside me, in a deadly race
But even in the face of defeat and pain
My loyalty to Japan never waned

In World War 2, I flew with pride
My wings took me where others would hide
I was a warrior, fearless and strong
My heart beat for Japan, all day long

I may have fallen, but my spirit lives on
In the hearts of my people, who carry on
I was a Japanese pilot, proud and true
And I fought for my country, through and through.
